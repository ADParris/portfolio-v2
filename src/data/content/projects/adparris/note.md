The original design of this site is by Brittany Chiang(a link to her website is in the footer of this site). I found the design to be beautiful and took it upon myself to recreate it. So, with the technologies that I'm familiar with, I did just that. I used Gatsby, as it's a single-page application with all the data in .md files. My preferred style system is Chakra-UI, which comes bundled with Framer Motion. So I read up on the motion component of Framer Motion and utilized that for all the site animations. It's not a 1 to 1 clone but, I think it turned out well.
