Hi, I'm Andrew, a self-taught web developer looking for the right company to begin my career, creating exceptional experiences on the web.

My interest in computers started when I received my first Commodore VIC-20, around the age of 9. A few years later, I discovered the bulletin boards when I received my first modem, all 300 baud of it.

My interest in web development started when I realized that I was more interested in creating the experience rather than using it. A few years later, with the help of a friend, we did just that. We had made our first online site, a bulletin board!

Several years later, I remember making a website with just HTML, CSS, and a bit of JQuery. Sure, it was simple by today's standards, but it was thrilling to think that people from around the world could see what I had created!

Fast-forwarding to today, and I have gone all-in on what I love to do. For the past two years, I have been learning several libraries and frameworks. Frameworks such as Express to build REST APIs, Apollo to build GraphQL APIs, and libraries such as React to build the front-end.
